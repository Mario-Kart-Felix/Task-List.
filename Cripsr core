The hardware platform used as the web server consists of a computer based on the
Intel® Xeon® CPU E5620 @2.4 GHz processor, with 8 cores and 2 threads per core, and
24 Gb RAM memory, as well as a GeForce RTX 2070 graphic device, with 2304 NVidia cores
and 8 GB GDDR6 RAM memory. The procedure steps implemented in the GPU have been
carried out using the CUDA V10.2.89 library. The client browsers to communicate with
the server were Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, and they were installed in personal
computers. The first test was executed with the client computer located in the same
university campus network, and the second test was executed from a personal computer
out of the campus network, but in the same metropolitan area.
The main parameter values for the first test (the first dataset) were coverage ratios one
and five, 0.25 and 0.3 as threshold values and DWT levels five, six and seven. Combining
these values, 12 different experiments were carried out. Table 1 shows the evaluation
results. This table shows the number of experiments in the column labeled as “exp”, the
coverage of each experiment in the column labeled as “cov”, the threshold value in the
column labeled as “thr”, and the DWT level in the column labeled as “dwt level”. The rest
of the columns shows the evaluation results: the number of DMRs found are shown in the
column labeled as “num DMRs”, the processing time in the web server is shown in the
column labeled as “process”, the response time provided to the user webpage is shown in
the column labeled as “response”, and the communication delay (in milliseconds), i.e., the
difference between the response time and the server processing time for each experiment,
are shown in the column labeled “comm delay”.

The number of DMRs detected (values in column “num DRMs”) is high due to the
very low coverage ratios used. Nevertheless, it can be seen that for a coverage ratio of
5 the number of detected DMRs is about one third of the number of DMRs detected with
a coverage ratio of 1, where there are a high number of samples with a single occurrence
of a read aligned in that DNA location. If we compare the number of DMRs found for
different dwt levels, we can see how the number of DMRs found decreases as the level of
DWT increases. This is due to the compression of the signal as the transformation level
is increased. All the times shown in the rest of the columns are directly related to the
number of DMRs found, as it could be expected. Thus, the response times are shorter for a
coverage ratio of 5, where a maximum response time of 1182 s is needed. Although these
times cannot be rated as interactive, they are efficient times if we take into account that
we are performing an automatic detection of all the DMRs in a chromosome. Also, it is
worth mention that for a coverage ratio of 1 the fraction of the response time devoted to
computation (column labeled as “process”) is between 0.64 and 0.75 for the different levels
of DWT, while this fraction is about 0.85 for a coverage ratio of 5.
Figure 8 shows the communication delay in milliseconds and the number of DMRs
found in each experiment. This figure shows a clear correlation between the two variables,
